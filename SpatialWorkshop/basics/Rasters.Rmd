# What is a raster?    
A raster is a spatially explicit matrix or `grid` where each cell represents a geographic location. Each cell represents a pixel on a surface. The size of each pixel defines the resolution or `res` of raster. The smaller the pixel size the finer the spatial resolution. The `extent` or spatial coverage of a raster is defined by the minima and maxima for both x and y coordinates.

Rasters can be created from the following data classes:
<ui>
<li> Numeric </li>
<li> Integer </li>
<li> Categorical </li>
</ui>

## Raster formats 
Raster data are stored in a variety of formats. The table below describes several commonly encountered file types. 

# Creating & writing rasters   
## Raster data in R
Let's begin by creating a raster from scratch. We'll use the `raster` package to make an empty raster, set the `extent` and resolution (`res`) and assign values. Once we create a raster in R - we'll take a closer look at the metadata and structure of rasters in `R`.

load the `raster` package if you haven't already done so. If you need to install the `raster` package - see how to do that [here](#install.packages)
```{r load-raster, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# load library
library(raster)
```

Now that the `raster` library is loaded we can use the `raster()` function to create a raster in `R`. 
```{r empty-raster}
# Create a raster from scratch using raster
firstRaster <- raster(xmn = -100,   # set minimum x coordinate
                      xmx = -60,    # set maximum x coordinate
                      ymn = 25,     # set minimum y coordinate
                      ymx = 50,     # set maximum y coordinate
                      res = c(1,1)) # resolution in c(x,y) direction
```

Here is what that raster looks like in `R`
```{r raster-data}
# Take a look at what the raster looks like
firstRaster
```
Notice that the object is of `class: RasterLayer` has 25 rows, 40 columns and 1000 cells. The resolution (`res`) is 1x1 degree. The raster's `extent` ranges from -100 to -60 degrees longitude and 25 to 50 degrees latitude. The coordinate reference is WGS84 by default because `raster` recognized our inputs as degrees longitude/latitude. It doesn't always do so. 

### Setting raster values
Currently there are no values associated with the raster layer we just created. It's empty. We can assign values to the raster in a few ways. We'll set the values of the raster using the `[]` convention. See the `setValues` function in the `raster` package for another way to set values of a raster. We'll sequence values from 1 to the number of cells within the raster. You can extract the number of cells within a raster using the `ncell` function.   
*note - the number of values you supply needs to be equivilant to the number of cells in the raster. You can however provide `NA` values.*
```{r set-values-raster}
# Assign values to raster 
firstRaster[] <- seq(from = 1, to = ncell(firstRaster),by = 1)

# Take a look at the raster now
firstRaster
```

You should now notice there are a few new attributes to our raster object. We gained `data source:`, `names` and `values` fields. The `data source` attribute tells us that the raster information is stored in our memory. The `names` field gave a name to the `values` we provided. The `values` we supplied are now contained in the `values` field. 

Now that the raster has values we can do a few things - like plot the raster.
```{r plot-raster-1}
plot(firstRaster)
```

### Reading and writing rasters

# Raster calculations 

# Projecting a raster 

# Extracting values from a raster

# Reclassifing & resampling rasters

```{r,message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}
# Generate random variables #
library(raster)

x <- runif(100,min = -101, max = -100)
y <- runif(100, 43,44)
coordinates <- sp::SpatialPoints(cbind(x,y))
plot(coordinates,pch = 19)

plot(rgeos::gBuffer(coordinates, byid = TRUE, width = 0.05),add = TRUE)
```

## Does this work
```{r}
r <- raster(ncol = 10, nrow = 10)
r[] <- 1:10
```

```{r}
plot(r)
```
