# Get Spatial! Using R as GIS is a workshop intended to introduce participants to using the free, 
# open-source program R as a geographic information system providing participants with an alternative
# to ArcMap or other proprietary GIS software. The objective of the workshop is to introduce and 
# provide participants with working examples of how to use R for spatial analyses and map making.

# Most of the Spatial Layers are already available on this machine. The "../Spatial_Layers" folder
# was intentionally placed so that the code for the workshop doesn't need to be altered. While you
# can't see the actual folder in your 'home' drive, it's there just one folder up hence the "../" 
# in the file code. 

# You're currently running RStudio through Amazon Web Services. All participants are sharing the
# memory (32 g) and spatial layers. Please be mindful of that before writing / removing files from the
# "../Spatial_Layers" folder. 

# RUNNING CODE - To run lines of code you need to physically press the Run key in the upper right
# of the Scripts window. The familiar shortcuts ('ctrl-r' for example) don't work. You will notice
# that the page refreshes if you use the shortcut but the code won't run. 

# BE SURE TO EXPORT YOUR SCRIPTS AT THE END OF THE WORKSHOP!!
# I'll be stopping Amazon Web Services after the course is finished. At that point, the scripts you 
# save on the server will be deleted. You can download any files you save to the server by expanding
# the 'more' button in the Files tab. Select the file/s you want to download and click 'Export'. 

# Good luck, happy coding & I hope you learn something new! 

# Mike, Clark and Jonathon
