# What is a raster?    
A raster is a spatially explicit matrix or `grid` where each cell represents a geographic location. Each cell represents a pixel on a surface. The size of each pixel defines the resolution or `res` of raster. The smaller the pixel size the finer the spatial resolution. The `extent` or spatial coverage of a raster is defined by the minima and maxima for both x and y coordinates.

Rasters can be created from the following data classes:
<ui>
<li> Numeric </li>
<li> Integer </li>
<li> Categorical </li>
</ui>

## Raster formats 
Raster data are stored in a variety of formats. The table below describes several commonly encountered file types. 

# Creating & writing rasters   
## Raster data in R
Let's begin by creating a raster from scratch. We'll use the `raster` package to make an empty raster, set the `extent` and resolution (`res`) and assign values. Once we create a raster in R - we'll take a closer look at the metadata and structure of rasters in `R`.

load the `raster` package if you haven't already done so. If you need to install the `raster` package - see how to do that [here](#install.packages)
```{r load-raster, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# load library
library(raster)
```

Now that the `raster` library is loaded we can use the `raster()` function to create a raster in `R`. 
```{r empty-raster}
# Create a raster from scratch using raster
firstRaster <- raster(xmn = -100,   # set minimum x coordinate
                      xmx = -60,    # set maximum x coordinate
                      ymn = 25,     # set minimum y coordinate
                      ymx = 50,     # set maximum y coordinate
                      res = c(1,1)) # resolution in c(x,y) direction
```

Here is what that raster looks like in `R`
```{r raster-data}
# Take a look at what the raster looks like
firstRaster
```
Notice that the object is of `class: RasterLayer` has 25 rows, 40 columns and 1000 cells. The resolution (`res`) is 1x1 degree. The raster's `extent` ranges from -100 to -60 degrees longitude and 25 to 50 degrees latitude. The coordinate reference is WGS84 by default because `raster` recognized our inputs as degrees longitude/latitude. It doesn't always do so.

### Setting raster values
Currently there are no values associated with the raster layer we just created. It's empty. We can assign values to the raster in a few ways. We'll set the values of the raster using the `[]` convention. See the `setValues` function in the `raster` package for another way to set values of a raster. We'll sequence values from 1 to the number of cells within the raster. You can extract the number of cells within a raster using the `ncell` function.   
*note - the number of values you supply needs to be equivilant to the number of cells in the raster. You can however provide `NA` values.*
```{r set-values-raster}
# Assign values to raster 
firstRaster[] <- seq(from = 1, to = ncell(firstRaster),by = 1)

# Take a look at the raster now
firstRaster
```

You should now notice there are a few new attributes to our raster object. We gained `data source:`, `names` and `values` fields. The `data source` attribute tells us that the raster information is stored in our memory. The `names` field gave a name to the `values` we provided. The `values` we supplied are now contained in the `values` field. 

Now that the raster has values we can do a few things - like plot the raster.
```{r plot-raster-1}
plot(firstRaster)
```

### Reading rasters from file

The `raster()` function within the `raster` package can also be used to read in a raster from file. Let's read in some <a href = "https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MOD_NDVI_M&date=2018-01-01" target="_blank">Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)</a> data from <a href="https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA's NEO</a>. See <a href = "https://mhallwor.github.io/_pages/whereToGetData.html" target = "_blank">where to get data</a> for other potential data sources. 

```{r}
# read in raster layer using raster function
# NDVI <- raster("path/to/raster/file")
NDVI <- raster::raster("../Spatial_Layers/MOD_NDVI_M_2018-01-01_rgb_3600x1800.FLOAT.TIFF")
```

Let's take a look at the data
```{r}
NDVI
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
par(bty="n",mar = c(0,0,0,3))
plot(NDVI, axes = FALSE)
```
<div style="background-color: #ffffe6; border-radius: 25px; text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding: 3px 0; margin: auto; width:600px; box-shadow: 4px 5px #f2f2f2;"> 
<h3><strong>Challenge</strong></h3>
<strong>Does the NDVI appear as you expected?</strong>
<li> If not, why? </li>
<li> What needs to be done to make it fit your expectations?</li>
</div>
```{r, echo = FALSE,warning = FALSE,message = FALSE}
# First option for making NDVI appear as expected
# set values larger than 2 to NA 
#NDVI[NDVI>2]<-NA
par(bty = "n",mar = c(0,0,2,3))
#plot(NDVI, axes = FALSE)

# Second option - leave NDVI values intact but
# only plot values within the range of 'normal' 
# NDVI values c(-0.1,0.9)
raster::plot(NDVI, axes = FALSE, zlim = c(-0.1,0.9))
```
