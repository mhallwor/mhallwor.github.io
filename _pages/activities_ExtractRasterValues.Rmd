Extracting raster data to an area or location of interest is a common GIS task. There are a few things to keep in mind while extracting raster data in R. First, as we've seen in <code>Projections</code> it's best to use projected data. Second, make sure the two layers have the same <code>coordinate reference system</code>. Lastly, make sure you know the data class you're extracting (i.e., continuous, factor, etc.)

## Extracting Raster to SpatialPoints

Extracting raster data to <code>SpatialLayers</code> can be done using the <code>extract</code> function in the <code>raster</code> package. See <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/raster/versions/2.6-7/topics/extract" target="_blank">extract function documentation</a> for details regarding options. 

### Gathering spatial data

For this first example, we'll use a digital elevation model (DEM) of Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The dem is of class numerical. Which means we can perform numerical calculations like finding the mean and range of the data. Below, we'll use a data set where the data are factors.

Reading in the DEM
```{r}
# read in DEM of HBEF
DEM <- raster::raster("../Spatial_Layers/hb10mdem.txt")
```

Each summer, the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute's Migratory Bird Center conducts point counts at nearly 400 locations throughout Hubbard Brook. The point count locations have been georeferenced. Let's extract the elevation of each survey location. First, we'll need to read in the in the survey locations.  

```{r}
SurveyLocs <- raster::shapefile("../Spatial_Layers/hbef_valleywideplots.shp")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
SurveyLocs
```
Before we proceed, let's make sure the <code>CRS</code> is the same in for both the raster layer (DEM) and the <code>SpatialPoints</code> layer. 

```{r}
crs(SurveyLocs)
crs(DEM)
```

The two layers have different <code>coordinate reference systems</code>. We'll need to transform the <code>SpatialPoints</code> layer to match the raster (DEM). See <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/_pages/projections#projecting-rasters" target="_blank">caution projecting rasters</a> for details on why we'll project the <code>SpatialPoints</code> instead of the raster. 

```{r}
# Transform points to match CRS of the DEM
SurveyLocs_proj <- sp::spTransform(x = SurveyLocs,
                                   CRSobj = crs(DEM))
```

Now that the two layers have the same <code>CRS</code> we can extract the elevation to survey points. We'll use the <code>extract</code> function available in the raster package. The first argument is the raster values you want to extract. The second argument (y) can be a <code>SpatialObject</code> or matrix. 

```{r}
# Extract elevation to SpatialPoints
surveyElev <- raster::extract(x = DEM,
                              y = SurveyLocs_proj)
```

The resulting object is a vector with the same length as <code>SurveyLocs_proj</code>. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
str(surveyElev)
```

We can add the data directly into the <code>SpatialPointsDataFrame</code> with the following code. 
```{r}
SurveyLocs_proj$Elev_m <- raster::extract(x = DEM,
                                          y = SurveyLocs_proj)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
SurveyLocs_proj
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
hist(surveyElev,col = "gray88",main = "",breaks = 15)
```

## Extract raster to polygon/s

Below, we'll determine the proportion of landcover types within Arizona. In order to complete this task, some new functions will be introduced but we'll also use some skills we learned in other activities. 

### Gathering spatial data

We're interested in quantifying landcover around Tucson, AZ or more broadly the landcover types found in Arizona. 

First, we'll read in the landcover classes. In this example, we'll use landcover data with a relatively coarse resolution for simplicity and speed. 

```{r}
# Read in landcover data
LandCover <- raster::raster("../Spatial_Layers/MCD12C1_T1_2011-01-01_rgb_3600x1800.TIFF")
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
LandCover
```
<br>
|Code|Land Cover Class|
|---|----|
|01|Evergreen Needleleaf forest|
|02|Evergreen Broadleaf forest|
|03|Deciduous Needleleaf forest|
|04|Deciduous Broadleaf forest|
|05|Mixed forest|
|06|Closed shrublands|
|07|Open shrublands|
|08|Woody savannas|
|09|Savannas|
|10|Grasslands|
|11|Permanent wetlands|
|12|Croplands|
|13|Urban and built-up|
|14|Cropland/Natural vegetation mosaic|
|15|Snow and ice|
|16|Barren or sparsely vegetated|
|17|Water bodies|
|18|Tundra|

Now that we have a basic Landcover layer, we'll can gather spatial data for Arizona. We'll grab the entire United States and then subset out Arizona. 
```{r}
States <- raster::getData("GADM", country = "United States", level = 1)
```

```{r}
AZ <- States[States$NAME_1=="Arizona",]
```

```{r, warning = FALSE,echo = FALSE}
AZ
```
Great - now we have a <code>SpatialPolygonsDataFrame</code> of Arizona. Take note of the <code>CRS</code>. 

Landcover types are factors since they're categorical. The reason that's important is because when extracting raster data there are options to apply a function to the underlying raster data. For example, the <code>extract</code> function allows users to specify a function like <code>mean</code> and the function will return the mean raster value under the area of interest. However, because landcover types are factors, returning the mean landcover type is meaningless. Instead, as a final result were interested in having a table giving the percent of each landcover type in Arizona. We'll work our way up to that. We'll start by first extracting the landcover types in Arizona using the <code>extract</code> function available in the <code>raster</code> package.

```{r}
# x = raster layer
# y = SpatialLayer

AZ_lc <- extract(x = LandCover,
                 y = AZ)
```
 
<div style="background-color: #ffffe6; border-radius: 25px; text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding: 3px 0; margin: auto; width:600px; box-shadow: 4px 5px #f2f2f2;"> 
<h4><strong>On your own:</strong></h4>
What does the <code>extract</code> function return? How are the data stored? How do you think the resulting object would differ if we had more than one <code>SpatialPolygon</code>?
</div>
<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Get the structure of the extracted data
str(AZ_lc)
```

The <code>extract</code> function returns a list with the raster values that fall within our area of interest. Let's summarize the data a little bit. We'll use the <code>table</code> function to briefly summarize the landcover types within Arizona. 
```{r}
table(AZ_lc)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
lower48 <- States[!(States$NAME_1 %in% c("Hawaii","Alaska")),]
plot(lower48)
plot(LandCover, add = TRUE, ext = raster::extent(lower48))
plot(lower48, add = TRUE)
plot(AZ,add = TRUE,border = "red",lwd = 2)
par(new = TRUE, fig = c(0.5,0.9,0.1,0.9), mar = c(1,1,1,1))
plot(AZ)
plot(LandCover, add = TRUE, ext = raster::extent(AZ))
plot(AZ, add = TRUE)
```

## Custom function to summarize landcover data # 

Let's write a simple function that returns the landcover data as a percentage. The first thing we'll do is make a sorted vector that has all the unique landcover types that are found in the landcover data set. 
```{r}
# sort the unique values in LandCover
z <- sort(unique(raster::values(LandCover)))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
z
```

Now that we have a sorted vector of all the landcover types in the LandCover raster - let's summarize the landcover types in Arizona. To do that we'll need to write a custom function. Our function will be called <code>summarizeLC</code>. The <code>summarizeLC</code> function will except three arguments: <code>x</code> = extracted landcover data, <code>LC_classes</code> = land cover classes in the data set & <code>LC_names</code> a vector that contains the names of the landcover types. We'll set <code>LC_names</code> = NULL so it's optional.

```{r}
summarizeLC <- function(x,LC_classes,LC_names = NULL){
               # Find the number of cells 
               y <- length(x)
               # Make a table of the cells
               tx <- table(x)
               # Create an empty array to store landcover data
               LC <- array(NA,c(1,length(LC_classes)))
               # Loop through the landcover types & return 
               # the number of cells within each landcover type
               for(i in seq(LC_classes)){
               LC[1,i] <- ifelse(LC_classes[i] %in% dimnames(tx)[[1]], 
                                 #if true
                                 tx[which(dimnames(tx)[[1]]==LC_classes[i])],
                                 # if false
                                 0) 
               } # end loop
               # Convert to percentage 
               LC <- LC/y
               # 
               if(!is.null(LC_names)){
                 colnames(LC)<-LC_names}
               else{colnames(LC)<-LC_classes}
        
               return(LC)
}
```

Here we'll apply our function to the extracted raster data. Remember, the extracted raster data (<code>AZ_lc</code>) are stored as a list. Because of that we'll use the <code>lapply</code> function to apply our function (<code>summarizeLC</code>) to all elements of a list. This is especially useful when you extract raster values to more than one polygon, as the extracted values are stored in separate lists. 

```{r}
summaryValues <- lapply(AZ_lc,FUN = summarizeLC,LC_classes = z)
```

Here is what the final result may look like. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Make a vector of all landcover types possible in the data set
LC_types <- c("Evergreen Needleleaf forest","Evergreen Broadleaf forest","Deciduous Needleleaf forest","Deciduous Broadleaf forest","Mixed forest","Closed shrublands","Open shrublands","Woody savannas","Savannas","Grasslands","Permanent wetlands","Croplands","Urban and built-up","Cropland/Natural vegetation mosaic","Snow and ice","Barren or sparsely vegetated","Water bodies","Tundra")

# Rerun the summarizeLC function providing the LC_names
summaryValues <- lapply(AZ_lc,
                        FUN = summarizeLC,
                        LC_classes = z,
                        LC_names = LC_types[z])

# Name the row "percent"
rownames(summaryValues[[1]]) <- "Percent"

# round to 3 digits and transpose the table 
round(t(summaryValues[[1]]),3)
```

<div style="background-color: #ffffe6; border-radius: 25px; text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding: 3px 0; margin: auto; width:600px; box-shadow: 4px 5px #f2f2f2;"> 
<h4><strong>On your own:</strong></h4>
Find the proportion of each landcover type within your state. Use the <code>extract</code> function and the custom <code>summarizeLC</code> function return the landcover percentages.

<h4><strong>Challenge:</strong></h4>
Compare and contrast the landcover classes for two or more states.
</div>
<br>

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Create a SpatialPolygons file with the states of interest
StatesOfInterest <- States[States$NAME_1 %in% c("New Hampshire","West Virginia"),]

# Extract the raster values 
SOI_lc <- extract(x = LandCover, y = StatesOfInterest)

lz <- sort(unique(unlist(SOI_lc)))

# Rerun the summarizeLC function providing the LC_names
summaryValues <- lapply(SOI_lc,
                        FUN = summarizeLC,
                        LC_classes = lz,
                        LC_names = LC_types[lz])
# use do.call to combine two or more lists
percentCover <- do.call('rbind',summaryValues)

rownames(percentCover)<-StatesOfInterest$NAME_1

round(t(percentCover),3)
```
