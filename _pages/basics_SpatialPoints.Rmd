This activity will introduce you to working with spatial points in R.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - this activity assumes you have a working knowledge of `R`

# What are spatial points?    
Spatial points are a set of spatially explicit coordinates that represent a geographic location. Each point represents a location on a surface. Spatial points are created from a series of x and y coordinates. Spatial points can be combined with data frames to create what's called a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`. The difference between `SpatialPoints` and `SpatialPointsDataFrame` are the attributes that are associated with the points. `SpatialPointsDataFrames` have additional information associated with the points (e.g., site, year, individual, etc.) while `SpatialPoints` contain only the spatial information about the point. 

# Creating & writing spatial points   
## Spatial Points in R
Let's begin by creating a set spatial points layer from scratch. We'll use the `sp` package to make a `SpatialPoints` object using randomly generated XY coordinates. Once we create a `SpatialPoints` object in R - we'll take a closer look at its metadata and structure.

load the `sp` package if you haven't already done so. If you need to install the `sp` package - see how to do that [here](#install.packages)
```{r load-raster, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# load library
library(sp)
```

Now that the `sp` library is loaded we can use the `SpatialPoints()` function to create a `SpatialPoints` object in `R`. 
```{r spatial-points}
# Generate 100 random X and Y coordinates 
# with longitude and latitude in the familiar
# degrees

x_coords <- runif(n = 100, min = -100, max = -80)
y_coords <- runif(n = 100, min = 25, max = 45)

# Have a look at the first coordinates
head(cbind(x_coords,y_coords))
```

Now that we have generated random coordinates we can make those data spatially explicit. We'll use the `SpatialPoints` function in the `sp` package to do that. Before we use the function let's see what arguments we need to pass to `SpatialPoints`.

```{r see-args}
args("SpatialPoints")
```

The `SpatialPoints` function is looking for coordinates (`coords`), a projection / datum argument (`proj4string`) and a bounding box (`bbox`). Both `proj4string` and `bbox` have preset values so we don't need to specify them - it'll use the defaults. Let's use those options for now. 

The `coords` input looking for a specific type of input. It needs a matrix or data.frame where the first column is longitude and second is latitude. **Note** - the order is <strong>LONGITUDE</strong> then <strong>LATITUDE</strong>.

```{r make-spatial-points}
# coords = c(longitude,latitude)

firstPoints <- SpatialPoints(coords = cbind(x_coords,y_coords))
```

Let's have a look at what we just created. 
```{r str-points}
str(firstPoints)
```

We can plot the points in space by simply using the `plot` function. 
```{r plot-points}
plot(firstPoints, pch = 19)
```

## Writing a shapefile
We can save our `firstPoints` object as a shapefile using the `raster` package. The `shapefile` function in the `raster` package is very convienent in that it can both read a shapefile into `R` but it can also write a `SpatialPoints` or other spatial object classes (lines, polygons, etc.) to a shapefile. 
```{r save-shp, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(raster)
shapefile(x = firstPoints, file = "path/to/output/file.shp")
```
