Welcome to Get Spatial! Before working through the set of activities it's best to have a recent version of R and RStudio. 

For reference, these activities were written using `r sessionInfo()[[1]]$version.string` on a Windows machine (`r sessionInfo()[[2]]`)

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); border-radius: 25px; text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:3px 0; width: 600px; margin: auto; box-shadow: 4px 5px gray;">
<h2>Update R and RStudio</h2>
You can install or update to the latest version of <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/"><code>R</code>here</a> and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">RStudio here</a>

<a name="install.packages"></a>

## Install required packages 
Before starting, run the following code to get all the packages we use in the activities / tutorials. 
```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
packagesNeeded <- readLines("../DEPENDS.txt")
pkgs <- paste0(packagesNeeded,collapse = ",")
pkgs <- gsub(x = pkgs, pattern = ",", replacement = '","')
cat("install.packages(c(",'"',"devtools",'","',pkgs,'"',"), dependencies = TRUE)",sep="")
```

```{r,echo = FALSE, message = FALSE,warning = FALSE,results='hide'}
install.packages(c("devtools","animation","dismo","gdalUtils","gstat","ks","leaflet","lwgeom","maps","maptools","raster","rasterVis","rgdal","rgeos","sf","sp","spatstat","tidyverse","velox"), dependencies = TRUE)
```

We also need some newer versions of packages that are only available on GitHub. Once you run the above code and/or have the <code>devtools</code> package you can get the required functions by running the following:
```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/rlang", build_vignettes = TRUE)
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")
```

## On Mac 
Download [GDAL](https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries) and install the .dmg file. 

Download the `rgdal` package from CRAN [found here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html).

Place the downloaded rgdal_1.2-16.tgz in your Desktop folder

Run `install.packages("~/Desktop/rgdal_1.2-16.tgz", repos=NULL)`

Install `raster` and `sp` by running: `install.packages(c("sp","raster"),dependencies = TRUE)`

## Correct installation
```{r,warning = FALSE}
library(raster)
library(sp)
library(rgeos)
library(rgdal)
```

Running Windows and interested in MODIS data? You will need <strong>OSGeo4W</strong> ([available for download here](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/)) because it comes with a HDF4 driver.
