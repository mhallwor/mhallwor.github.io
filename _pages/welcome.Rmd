Welcome to Get Spatial! Using R as GIS. This material is intended to introduce you to the different spatial data types and how to create, read, manipulate and analyze spatial data in `R`. The exercises are geared towards analyses that are commonly found in the field of ornithology but are likely applicable to other fields as well. The lessons / activities range in complexity from reading in XY coordinates and making a shapefile to generating origin assignments using stable-isotopes.  

This workshop assumes the user has a general understanding of the `R` language. 

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - this activity assumes you have a working knowledge of `R`
