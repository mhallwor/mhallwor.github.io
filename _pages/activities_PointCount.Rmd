# Point-count like data
For this activity, let's assume you're getting ready to start a new project. In this project the primary form of data collection is through the use of point counts. Let's assume you already know you want to survey birds within the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/coronado/home" target="_blank">Coronado National Forest</a> the system in which you want to survey. 

```{r warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(raster)
library(sp)
library(rgeos)
```

Read in a shapefile that contains information about the national forest boundaries in the United States. The shapefile was downloaded from <a href ="https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?dsetCategory=boundaries" target="_blank"> here </a>

```{r}
# Read in Administrative forest boundaries 
# This shapefile has boundary information
# for forests the U.S. federal govt is
# responsible for - i.e., National Forests,
# National Monuments, etc. 

NatForest <- raster::shapefile("../Spatial_Layers/S_USA.AdministrativeForest.shp")

# Take a glance at the file
NatForest
```

Let's pull out just the Coronado National Forest. Here we use the <code>grep()</code> function to search for 'Coronado' within the <code>FORESTNAME</code> field. 
```{r}
CNF <- NatForest[grep(x=NatForest$FORESTNAME,pattern="Coronado"),]
```

We're going to need a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for our analysis. For convience we'll grab a DEM using the 'alt' (elevation) data set available with the raster package. Note - when using the raster to download elevation in the United States - a list is returned. The first element of the list is the elevation (in meters) of the contiguous states. The other elements include Alaska, and Hawaii.
```{r get-elev}
# Get elevation data using the raster package
DEM <- raster::getData(name = "alt", country = "United States")

# Save only the elevation in the lower 48
DEM <- DEM[[1]]
```

```{r plot-CNF, echo = FALSE}
par(bty = "n")
plot(DEM,ext = extent(CNF),axes = FALSE)
plot(CNF, add = TRUE)
```

## Generate point count locations
The <code>sp</code> package has a function to generate random points. It has a few options but here we'll use <code>type = "regular"</code> to generate random points that are systematically aligned. The <code>n</code> is the approximate sample size. We'll also set the seed for the random number generator so you should get the same locations. 

```{r make-random}
set.seed(12345)

surveyPts <- sp::spsample(x = CNF, n = 100, type = "regular")
```

Let's take a look at how many sites were generated and where they ended up. 
```{r}
plot(CNF)
plot(surveyPts, add = TRUE, pch = 19)
```

## Generate buffer around points
Now that we have generate survey points - let's make a 50m radius around each point.

Before we go any further we need to know a few things. We need to know if the <code>coordinate reference system (crs)</code> is defined for our survey points and we also need to what the <code>crs</code> is. To make our lives easier if would be good to have the surveyPoints projected into an Equal Area projection in meters. The reason for this is two-fold. First, an equal area projection will conserve area so our buffers should be accurate and second, if it's in a meters we can specify the <code>width</code> parameter in meters. 

```{r}
surveyPts
```

Project the points into an equal area projection. While we're at it - let's project all our layers (DEM, forest boundaries, and survey points).
```{r}
# Define the projection in proj4 format
EqArea <- "+proj=aea 
           +lat_1=20 +lat_2=60 +lat_0=40 +lon_0=-96 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 
           +ellps=GRS80 
           +datum=NAD83 
           +units=m +no_defs"

# project data using the sp package
surveyPts_m <- sp::spTransform(surveyPts, sp::CRS(EqArea))

# project forest boundary
CNF_m <- sp::spTransform(CNF, sp::CRS(EqArea))
```

Now for the DEM - it's quite large and we only need a small portion. Let's crop the DEM to include only the area around Coronado National Forest.

```{r}
DEM <- crop(DEM,CNF)

# take a look
DEM
```

```{r}
DEM_m <- projectRaster(DEM, crs = EqArea)
```

Now that we've projected the data we can generate the 50m radius around each point. To do this make sure to use <code>byid = TRUE</code>.
```{r}
library(rgeos)
surveyCircle <- gBuffer(surveyPts_m, width = 50, byid = TRUE)
```

Extract elevation to the survey locations
```{r}
pt_elev <- extract(DEM_m, surveyCircle, fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
par(bty = "l")
hist(pt_elev, xlab = "Elevation", ylab = "Frequency", main = "",
     col = "gray", border = "gray88", yaxt = "n")
axis(2,las = 2)
```

### Simulate count data 
We'll simulate occupancy data using a function from Kery & Royle 2016 <a href = "https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/pubanalysis/keryroylebook/" target="_blank">Applied Hierarchical Modeling in Ecology</a>. Here we use the simOcc function saving most of the preset values. We just want the count data so I save only the <code>y</code> ouput. 
```{r, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#library(AHMbook)
#library(unmarked)

# Simulate occupancy data
# M = number of sites 
# J = number of occassions

simCount <- AHMbook::simOcc(M = length(surveyPts), 
                            J = 3, 
                            mean.occupancy = 0.6, 
                            mean.detection = 0.7,
                            show.plot = FALSE)$y

# see first few rows
head(simCount)
```

Using these simulated data, we'll determine the relationship between elevation and occupancy while accounting for imperfect detection using the <code>unmarked</code> package. 
```{r}
# Make unmarked frame for occupancy data
umf <- unmarked::unmarkedFrameOccu(y = simCount, 
                                   siteCovs=data.frame(pt_elev), 
                                   obsCovs=NULL)

# run the occupancy model
occ <- unmarked::occu(~1~pt_elev,umf)
```

## Map occupancy probability 

Let's create a map of the predicted occupancy probabilty throughout the Coronado National Forest. We'll use the parameter estimates from the occupancy model we ran above. 

```{r}
occMap <- exp(unmarked::coef(occ)[1]+unmarked::coef(occ)[2]*DEM_m)/
          (1+exp(unmarked::coef(occ)[1]+unmarked::coef(occ)[2]*DEM_m))

plot(mask(occMap, CNF_m),col = bpy.colors(30))
```
